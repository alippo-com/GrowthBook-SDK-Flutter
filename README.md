# GrowthBook SDK for flutter.

![](https://docs.growthbook.io/images/hero2.png)



## Overview

GrowthBook is an open source feature flagging and experimentation platform that makes it easy to adjust what features are shown users, and run A/B tests, without deploying new code. There are two parts to GrowthBook, the GrowthBook Application, and the SDKs which implement this functionality to your code base. This Flutter SDK allows you to use GrowthBook with your Flutter based mobile application.

- **Lightweight and fast**
- **Supports**
  - **Android**
  - **iOS**
  - **Mac**
  - **Windows**
- **Use your existing event tracking (GA, Segment, Mixpanel, custom)**
- **Adjust variation weights and targeting without deploying new code**



## Installation

1. Add GrowthBook SDK as dependency in your pubspec.yaml file.
```yaml
growthbook_sdk_flutter: ^1.1.0
```

## Integration

Integration is super easy:

1. Create a GrowthBook API key from the GrowthBook App.
2. Initialize the SDK at the start of your app using the API key, as below.

Now you can start/stop tests, adjust coverage and variation weights, and apply a winning variation to 100% of traffic, all within the Growth Book App without deploying code changes to your site.

```dart
final GrowthBookSDK sdkInstance = GBSDKBuilderApp(
  apiKey: "<API_KEY>",
  attributes: {
    /// Specify attributes.
  },
  growthBookTrackingCallBack: (gbExperiment, gbExperimentResult) {},
  hostURL: '<GrowthBook_URL>',
).initialize();

```

There are additional properties which can be setup at the time of initialization

```dart
    final GrowthBookSDK newSdkInstance = GBSDKBuilderApp(
    apiKey: "<API_KEY>",
    attributes: {
     /// Specify user attributes.
    },
    growthBookTrackingCallBack: (gbExperiment, gbExperimentResult) {},
    hostURL: '<GrowthBook_URL>',
).setNetworkDispatcher(
  // set network dispatcher.
)
   .setForcedVariations({})
   . // Set forced variations
   setQAMode(true)// Set qamode
   .initialize();

```



## Usage

- Initialization returns SDK instance - GrowthBookSDK
  ###### Use sdkInstance to consume below features -

- The feature method takes a single string argument, which is the unique identifier for the feature and returns a FeatureResult object.

  ```dart
    GBFeatureResult feature(String id) 
  ```

- The run method takes an Experiment object and returns an ExperimentResult

```dart
    GBExperimentResult run(GBExperiment experiment)   
```

- Get Context

```dart
    GBContext getGBContext()
```

- Get Features

```dart
    GBFeatures getFeatures()  
```



## Models

```dart
/// Defines the GrowthBook context.
class GBContext {
  GBContext({
    this.apiKey,
    this.hostURL,
    this.enabled,

  String? hostURL;

  /// Switch to globally disable all experiments. Default true.
  bool? enabled;

  /// Map of user attributes that are used to assign variations

  /// Force specific experiments to always assign a specific variation (used for QA).
  Map<String, dynamic>? forcedVariation;

  /// If true, random assignment is disabled and only explicitly forced variations are used.
  bool? qaMode;

  /// A function that takes experiment and result as arguments.
  TrackingCallBack? trackingCallBack;

  /// Keys are unique identifiers for the features and the values are Feature objects.
  /// Feature definitions - To be pulled from API / Cache
  GBFeatures features = <String, GBFeature>{};

```



```dart

  /// When source is "experiment", this will be the Experiment object used
  GBExperiment? experiment;
